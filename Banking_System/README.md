# Bank Balance Sheets

### Assets
#### Total Reserves
##### Required Reserves
* Required Reserves
    * Percentage of checkable deposits required to be held at any given time. This value is set by the federal reserve. Historically, it was around 10%, currently it is at 0%. 
    * These cannot be loaned out or utilized for business operations. 
* Excess Reserves
    * This is free capital and can be utilized for business operations
#### Loans
* Nothing special here, loans are loans. Banking institutions loan out excess reserves to customers. Banks gain interest income from this activity and have "loans receivable" accounts, i.e. the principal owed by customers to the institution. 

#### Securities
* Other assets can exist on a bank's balance sheet. We will not explore these areas. 

### Liabilities

#### Checkable Deposits
* These are deposits held within the bank which they owe to individuals / customers. 
    * If deposit is made, the amount increases and vice versa.
* Savings accounts / deposits also exist. Operate the same way, but do not have a ratio of required reserves. 

### Equity

* For our discussion, we consider start up capital as owner's equity. 

## Examples 

### Deposits
* An individual makes a deposit of $100 into their checking account, while the reserve rate is 10%. 
    * Checkable deposits increases by $100 (credit)
    * Total Reserves Increase by $100 (debit)
        * Required Reserves increases by $10
        * Excess Reserves increases by $90

* Same individual withdraws $1000 from their checking account. 
    * Checkable deposits decreases by $1,000 (debit)
    * Total Reserves decreases by $1000, (credit)
        * Required Reserves decreases by $100
        * Excess Reserves decreases by $900

### Loans 

* An individual applies and is offered a 2 year $10k loan at 5% interest. 

    * Initially, we offer the loan.
        * Total Reserves decreases by $10k (credit)
            * Excess Reserves decreases by $10k 
        * Loan Balance increases by $10k (debit)            
        * We could add complexity here and recognize interest receivable, instead we will recognize when the loan is repaid. 
    * Finally, our loan is repaid. 
        * Total Reserves increase by $10k (debit)
            * Excess Reserves increase by $10k 

        * Loan Balance decreases by $10k (credit)

        * Total Reserves Increases by $529 (debit)
            * Excess Reserves increse by $529
            * This is reflecting our interest gained, which in all truth would decrease another receivable, but we do not accommodate this.
